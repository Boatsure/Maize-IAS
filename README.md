A Maize Image Analysis Software using Deep Learning for High-throughput Plant Phenotyping

On the boundary between computer vision and plant science, we utilize advanced deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks to empower the workflow of maize phenotyping analysis.  This is an integrated application supporting one-click analysis of maize phenotype, embedding multiple functions: I. Projection, II. Color Analysis, III. Internode length, IV. Height, V. Stem Diameter and VI. Leaves Counting. Taking the RGB image of maize as input, the software provides a user-friendly graphical interaction interface and rapid calculation of multiple important phenotypic characteristics, including leaf sheath points detection and leaves segmentation
